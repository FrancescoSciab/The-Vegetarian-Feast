## The Vegetarian Feast - React Project by Francesco Sciabbarrasi

This is a website created as the fifth practical project at Start2Impact University. Within my Start2Impact profile, I chose to focus on the United Nations' goals related to Good Health and Well-being, as well as Climate Action. Consequently, I developed "The Vegetarian Feast," a website that provides vegetarian recipes using the Spoonacular API

# Project Explanation

The website features a homepage with a carousel of some random recipes, a section to select the desired meal type, and a unique idea to enhance user experience: a box with TikTok videos showcasing vegetarian recipes. The navbar, complete with a search bar, and the footer are present on every page of the site.

# Technical Details

- Framework: React with React Router to manage individual pages of the Single Page Application (SPA).
- Interface: Use of React Bootstrap, React-Slick, and SCSS for formatting.
- API Handling: Axios for API calls and React-Social-Media-Embed to embed TikTok videos.
- Optimized API Calls: Based on the route, the third and fourth "Row" of the site make specific API calls, reducing the overall number.
- Intelligent Search Bar: The search bar utilizes the "useNavigate" hook from React Router, using the user's query as a "path" for navigation.
- Email Handling: Implementation of a form to allow users to send emails, using EmailJS for security.
